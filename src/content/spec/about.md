# About

Hi there, I'm Rudy! A passionate systems programmer and cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep love for creating efficient, secure, and robust software. My journey in tech began with a fascination for how things work under the hood, which naturally led me to C and C++, with Rust later becoming an instant love of mine. I’m also dedicated to offensive security and CTFs where I play with my team OSUSEC!
